# FeatureEnVi: Visual Analytics for Feature Engineering Using Stepwise Selection and Semi-Automatic Extraction Approaches

This Git repository contains the code that accompanies the research paper "FeatureEnVi: Visual Analytics for Feature Engineering Using Stepwise Selection and Semi-Automatic Extraction Approaches". The details of the experiments and the research outcome are described in [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2022.3141040).

**Note:** t-viSNE is optimized to work better for standard resolutions (such as 1440p/QHD (Quad High Definition) and 1080p). Any other resolution might need manual adjustment of your browser's zoom level to work properly.
